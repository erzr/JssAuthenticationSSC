# Sitecore JSS Authentication with Sitecore SSC
Login forms are cool! Here's an example of a Login Form that authenticates with Sitecore SSC. After a user is logged in, an integrated GraphQL query is executed to fetch user profile data, such as the users full name. This example relies on the `whoAmI` query that is shown in the [Sitecore JSS documentation](https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/techniques/graphql/graphql-overview). I've pulled this query into the GraphQLExtensions library that is available [here](https://github.com/erzr/JssGraphQLExtensions).
